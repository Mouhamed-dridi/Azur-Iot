This repo shows you how to connect IoT devices with Azure and create IoT projects! üåêüí°
1. **IoT Device**: A device with sensors and software that connects to the internet to exchange data with other devices and systems.

2. **EGD in IoT World**: Edge Gateway Device - acts as a middleman between IoT devices and the cloud, processing data locally for efficiency and security.

3. **Why Cloud for IoT Projects**: Cloud platforms offer scalability, data storage, remote management, integration capabilities, and security for efficient and effective IoT solutions.

Creating an IoT environment with Azure typically involves these steps:

### Create Azure IoT Hub: 
- Start by creating an Azure IoT Hub, which acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between IoT devices and your Azure solution. You can manage and monitor your IoT devices securely with IoT Hub.

### Connect IoT Devices to Azure IoT Hub:
- Once your IoT Hub is set up, you need to connect your IoT devices to it. This involves provisioning devices and configuring them to securely communicate with your IoT Hub using protocols like MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS. Each device is assigned a unique identifier and authentication credentials to ensure secure communication.

### Send and Receive Messages between Devices and Cloud: 

With your devices connected to IoT Hub, you can start sending messages from your devices to the cloud and vice versa. Devices can send telemetry data, such as sensor readings, to IoT Hub, and cloud applications can send commands or configuration updates back to the devices. Azure IoT Hub handles message routing, scaling, and device management, making it easy to build scalable and reliable IoT solutions.
